# Pyber_Analysis
Analysis for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. Im going to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries.

# Assignment
Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The main query we are looking, is to know how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Analysis :
In a first approach to the database provided by PyBer, we were able to observe that the greater the number of rides, the greater the number of drivers but at lower fares. In particular, it was observed that urban cities have a large number of rides and drivers, however, the fares used are lower than those observed in rural cities; which, despite having few rides and few drivers compared to urban and suburban cities, have higher rides fares.

Regarding the number of rides, indeed, rural cities have the lowest number, with urban cities being the main clients of PyBer. In the same sense, we find that the number of drivers is low in rural cities, since these have a lower number than urban cities; which is linked to the fact that they also have a smaller number of drivers, so it has a lot to do with the number of rides requested.

Contrary to fares, rural cities have higher fares than urban cities. Therefore, rural cities should not be ruled out as potential clients for PyBer.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
